I wasn’t old enough to have an account when my brother created a profile for me. At one point, it was the oldest social platform I had under my ‘name’. After reading George Orwell’s 1984, I was inspired to delete my Facebook account. This book, along with realizing how these social media platforms slowly became a medium that promoted sexual content and kept us entertained for extended periods through endless scrolling, prompted my decision. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve deleted my Instagram account multiple times. I actually enjoyed the app; it was a good medium to share the various pictures I took on my handheld device. I tried deleting my account for 30 days, but it went further than that after I realized that I didn’t really need to be on the app and that I wasn’t missing out on anything. The millions of people posting and reacting to all the information shared on those social networking platforms were still going to do it regardless of whether I joined them or not. I find no amusement in these platforms like I used to. Like many others, I felt that I was just wasting my time consuming content rather than doing something meaningful. Death to Social Media. <br> -Jose",
